a# Softphone
A python 3 compatible softphone built on the [pjproject fork by malarinv, branch:py37](https://github.com/DiscordPhone/pjproject/tree/py37).

To use the streaming capability, use an Audio Callback class that suits your needs.

## TODO
- [ ] Fix the slight audio lag/delay when using Audio Callbacks for relaying audio between systems.
- [x] Check if adjusting pj thread value helps on the lag like [here](https://github.com/malarinv/pjproject/commit/2757c5553b8b05196ffc3fbbf3c09e63d2d79c89). **Helped a little bit..? Not sure, can be a coincidence.**
- [x] Clean up the code.
- [ ] Write documentation for all functions.
- [x] Add proper logging.
- [ ] Add DTMF support.
- [ ] Add call transfer support.
- [x] Fix and test incoming calls.
- [ ] Do not force registration of both incoming and outgoing accounts. Make it optional.
- [ ] Fix better error handling.
- [ ] Fix error when phone hangs up before softphone does.
- [ ] Fix error when phone is not answered and we reach voicemail. Softphone becomes unresponsive.
- [ ] Create a [Pypi package](https://pypi.org/) to install via `pip install softphone`.
- [ ] Add support for multiple simultaneous calls.
